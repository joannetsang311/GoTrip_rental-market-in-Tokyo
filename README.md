# GoTrip Tokyo: Short-Term Rental Market Entry Strategy
## Project Overview
This project was the capstone for the Generation Hong Kong Junior Data Analyst Bootcamp. Our team was tasked with assisting GoTrip, an Online Travel Agent (OTA), in its strategic entry into the short-term rental market in Tokyo, Japan. 

The project emphasizes data-driven recommendations for:
- Location Selection: Identifying high-potential neighborhoods for listings.
- Pricing Strategies: Dynamic pricing models to maximize revenue.
- Host Dependency: Strategies to build loyalty among rental hosts, encouraging exclusive or preferential listings on GoTrip.

Our work leverages the Inside Airbnb dataset for Tokyo (captured on June 27, 2025), providing a comprehensive snapshot of the local market.

The analysis was conducted using a 12-week agile framework by a team of four data analysts. My primary responsibilities encompassed Project Management, Presentation & Data Visualization, and a deep-dive analysis into the impact of amenities on occupancy to formulate a strategic growth plan.

Hypothesis: By analyzing competitor data (Airbnb), we can identify underserved locations, optimal pricing tiers, and key amenity offerings that maximize occupancy, providing GoTrip with a data-driven blueprint for a successful market entry.


## Business Objectives
- Market Trend Analysis: Evaluate occupancy rates, demand patterns, and competitive landscape.
- Pricing Optimization: Develop data-backed pricing guidelines based on amenities, location, and seasonality.
- Opportunity Identification: Pinpoint underserved segments (e.g., amenity-driven demand) for targeted growth.
- Strategic Planning: Propose actionable plans to enhance host engagement and platform adoption.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Inside Airbnb - Tokyo, Japan
- **Date:** June 27, 2025
- **Files:** listings.csv, calendar.csv, reviews.csv

## Methodology
Data Analysis (Python)
Employed Python with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for EDA and modeling:
- Cleaning & Prep: Managed nulls/outliers via conditional logic (if-elif) and custom functions (def).
- Manipulation: Aggregated data (groupby), integrated datasets (merge), and engineered features like amenity scores.
- Visualization: Created trend charts (e.g., occupancy vs. amenities) and geospatial maps.

## Role & Contributions
In my capacity as project manager and presentation lead:
- Managed timelines and team deliverables.
- Crafted visuals in Canva for final_presentation.pdf, highlighting amenity-occupancy links via infographics.
- Spearheaded amenity analysis, finding premium features (e.g., gym/pool) yield 20% higher bookings.
- Contributed to the strategic plan, proposing host perks like commission rebates.

## Key Learnings
- Python Proficiency: Mastered groupby, merge, function definitions (def), conditional flows (if-elif), and chart scripting.
- Power BI Expertise: Quick dashboard builds, DAX querying, and conversational analytics.
- Professional Growth: Enhanced PM skills, visualization storytelling, and collaborative analysis.
